# MFA and Password Reset Implementation âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. âœ… Enhanced Password Reset

**File:** `lib/src/reset_sheet.dart`

**Features:**
- Two-phase flow: Request code â†’ Confirm with new password
- Improved error handling with friendly messages:
  - `CodeMismatchException` â†’ "Incorrect code. Please try again."
  - `ExpiredCodeException` â†’ "Code expired. Please request a new one."
  - `InvalidPasswordException` â†’ "Password does not meet requirements. Check policy."
  - `LimitExceededException` â†’ "Too many attempts. Please try again later."

**UI Improvements:**
- Better form validation and error display
- Visual error boxes with icons
- Success snackbar after password reset
- Proper disposal of text controllers
- Email confirmation message

### 2. âœ… MFA Integration

**Note:** MFA is handled automatically by Cognito Hosted UI.

**How it works:**
1. Admin enables MFA in Cognito User Pool settings (SMS or TOTP)
2. When users sign in via Hosted UI, Cognito prompts them to:
   - **Enroll** MFA if first time (scan QR for TOTP)
   - **Enter code** for future sign-ins
3. The app doesn't need special MFA code - it's handled by Hosted UI

**Home Screen Display:**
- Shows "Security Settings" card
- Explains that MFA is automatic via Hosted UI
- No buttons needed - handled transparently

## How to Use

### Password Reset

1. Click "Forgot password?" on login screen
2. Enter email address
3. Click "Send Code"
4. Check email/SMS for verification code
5. Enter code and new password
6. Click "Confirm Reset"
7. Success! Sign in with new password

### MFA Setup

**For Admin:**
1. Go to AWS Cognito Console
2. Navigate to User Pool settings
3. Go to "MFA and verifications"
4. Enable SMS and/or TOTP
5. Choose "Optional" or "Required"

**For Users:**
1. Sign in via Hosted UI
2. If MFA is enabled, Cognito will:
   - Show QR code for TOTP (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
   - Or send SMS code
3. Scan QR code / Enter SMS code
4. Complete sign-in

## Error Handling

### Password Reset Errors

| Error | User Message |
|-------|--------------|
| `CodeMismatchException` | Incorrect code. Please try again. |
| `ExpiredCodeException` | Code expired. Please request a new one. |
| `InvalidPasswordException` | Password does not meet requirements. Check policy. |
| `LimitExceededException` | Too many attempts. Please try again later. |

### Common Password Policy Issues

Typical Cognito requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

## Testing Checklist

### Password Reset
- [ ] Click "Forgot password?" button
- [ ] Enter valid email
- [ ] Receive verification code (email/SMS)
- [ ] Enter correct code and valid new password
- [ ] Success message appears
- [ ] Can sign in with new password
- [ ] Test incorrect code error
- [ ] Test expired code error
- [ ] Test invalid password error

### MFA
- [ ] Admin enables MFA in Cognito
- [ ] User signs in for first time
- [ ] Cognito prompts to enroll TOTP
- [ ] User scans QR code with authenticator app
- [ ] Next sign-in prompts for TOTP code
- [ ] Code validation works

## Architecture

```
Login Screen
  â”œâ”€ Sign In (Hosted UI)
  â”œâ”€ Create Account
  â””â”€ Forgot Password â†’ Reset Sheet
       â”œâ”€ Request Code
       â””â”€ Confirm Reset

Home Screen (After Sign-In)
  â”œâ”€ User Profile
  â”œâ”€ Security Info (MFA handled by Cognito)
  â””â”€ Refresh/Sign Out
```

---

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `lib/src/reset_sheet.dart` - Enhanced with error handling
2. âœ… `lib/src/home_screen.dart` - Added security section
3. âœ… `lib/src/auth_service.dart` - Added MFA preference method (ready for future use)

---

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

If you want more MFA control in-app later:

### Option A: Use Amplify's associateSoftwareToken
```dart
final result = await Amplify.Auth.associateSoftwareToken();
// Show QR code in your app using the secret
// Then verify with updateSoftwareToken
```

### Option B: Keep Hosted UI for MFA
âœ… **Recommended** - Simplest and most secure

## Security Best Practices

âœ… Passwords never logged or displayed  
âœ… Verification codes expire after reasonable time  
âœ… Rate limiting prevents code brute force  
âœ… JWT tokens stored securely by Amplify SDK  
âœ… CORS properly configured on backend  
âœ… Access tokens used (not ID tokens) for API calls

## Ready to Use! ðŸŽ‰

The app now supports:
- âœ… Password reset with email/SMS verification
- âœ… Automatic MFA via Cognito Hosted UI
- âœ… Friendly error messages
- âœ… Success confirmations

Test it out! ðŸš€
