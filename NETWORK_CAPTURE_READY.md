## üéØ What You Can Do

### Verify Authorization Headers

```powershell
# 1. Capture during tests
npm run test:with-capture

# 2. Open in Wireshark
wireshark captures/api_capture_*.pcapng

# 3. Apply filter
http.request.line contains "Authorization"
```

### Debug HTTP Errors

```
# Filter in Wireshark
http.response.code >= 400
```

### Check TLS/Security

```
# Filter in Wireshark
tcp.port == 8080 && !tls
```

### Analyze Login Flow

```
# Filter in Wireshark
http.request.uri contains "/api/auth/login"
```

## üìù Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Run as Administrator

**Critical:** Network capture requires admin privileges on Windows.

Always right-click PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator" before capturing.

### üîß Interface Configuration

Your system has these interfaces available:
- **Interface 10** - Loopback (best for localhost:8080) ‚úÖ
- Interface 6 - Wi-Fi
- Interface 9 - Ethernet

The script is configured to use interface 10 (loopback) by default.

## üß™ Test It Now

```powershell
# Run this command (as Administrator)
cd "C:\Users\SathijaDeshapriya\Downloads\IT Center Project 2"
$env:PATH += ";C:\Program Files\Wireshark"

# Verify TShark works
tshark --version

# Should show: TShark (Wireshark) 4.6.0

# List interfaces
tshark -D

# Should show interface 10 for loopback
```

## üéì Next Steps

1. **Read the quick guide:** [HOW_TO_RUN_NETWORK_CAPTURE.md](./HOW_TO_RUN_NETWORK_CAPTURE.md)
2. **Start your backend:** Make sure it's running on port 8080
3. **Run a test capture:** `npm run test:with-capture`
4. **Open in Wireshark:** Analyze the captured traffic
5. **Try different filters:** From [docs/WIRESHARK_FILTERS.md](./docs/WIRESHARK_FILTERS.md)

## üí° Tips

1. **Always run as Administrator** for capture to work
2. **Use display filters** to quickly find what you need
3. **Follow TCP Stream** (right-click packet) to see complete exchanges
4. **Save useful filters** in Wireshark for quick access
5. **Delete old captures** to save space
