# 🚀 START HERE - Run E2E Tests

## What to Do

**Just run this one command:**

```powershell
npm run e2e
```

## What This Does

1. ✅ **Starts Mock API** → Fake backend on port 5050 (no real backend needed!)
2. ✅ **Starts Web App** → Your React app on port 5173 (pointing to mock API)
3. ✅ **Runs Tests** → All Selenium tests automatically
4. ✅ **Stops Everything** → Cleans up when done

## What You'll See

```
[0] JSON Server is running on http://localhost:5050
[1] Local: http://localhost:5173
[2] 
[2]   User Role Management
[2]     ✓ should open Users page and list users

[2] 
[2]   Audit Log
[2]     ✓ should show audit log with role events
[2] 
[2]   3 passing (45s)
```

## ❌ You DON'T Need To:

- ❌ Log in manually
- ❌ Start backend server
- ❌ Update credentials
- ❌ Do anything else!

## ✅ That's It!

Just run `npm run e2e` and wait for results. The tests run automatically with mock data.
